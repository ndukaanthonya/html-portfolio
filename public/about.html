<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Annaelechukwu, an experienced community specialist passionate about driving growth, inclusion, and innovation through technology. With over four years of hands-on experience in Web3, education, and grassroots mobilization, I’ve built and nurtured communities that connect people to impactful opportunities—whether in blockchain, digital literacy, or sustainable development. My work spans across student ecosystems, nonprofit initiatives, and DAO environments, where I’ve led programs, hosted events, and supported talent development.</p>

<p>I currently lead and support multiple initiatives including BlockchainUNN, Celo Africa DAO, and Plogging Nigeria, where I champion digital adoption, environmental advocacy, and decentralized finance. From organizing large campus tech summits to managing Telegram communities and launching ambassador programs, I thrive at the intersection of education, empowerment, and emerging technologies. My focus is always on helping individuals unlock value—whether that’s earning with stablecoins, gaining public speaking skills, or learning how to thrive in the tech world.</p>

<p>Outside work, I’m deeply invested in teaching, mentoring, and helping others find their voice—especially young Africans navigating the future of work. I believe in building for impact, and my journey reflects a commitment to service, continuous learning, and meaningful connections. Whether I’m behind a mic, building a team, or writing strategy, I bring energy, empathy, and clarity to everything I do.</p>
